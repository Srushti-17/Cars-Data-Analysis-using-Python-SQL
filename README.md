# Cars-Data-Analysis-using-Python-SQL

This project involves exploring and analyzing a Kaggle dataset containing specifications and performance details of various cars. The dataset includes information such as manufacturer, model, engine capacity, horsepower, performance metrics, pricing, and fuel type.

## Dataset Overview
* **File Name**: car_dataset_2025.csv
* **Rows**: 1,218
* **Columns**: 11
* **Source**: Kaggle

## Features

* **Car Company Names**: Manufacturer or brand of the car
* **Car Models**: Specific model or series
* **Engine Types**: Engine specification details
* **CC/Battery Capacity**: Engine displacement (cc) or battery capacity (electric cars)
* **Horsepower (HP)**: Power output of the engine/motor
* **Top Speed (km/h)**: Maximum achievable speed
* **Performance (0–100 km/h)**: Acceleration time from 0 to 100 km/h in secs
* **Price (USD)**: Listed price in US dollars
* **Fuel Type**: Petrol, diesel, electric, or hybrid
* **Seating Capacity**: Number of passengers
* **Torque**: Rotational force generated by the engine

## Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Removed unwanted characters and units
   * Handled ranges and standardized values
   * Prepared clean dataset for SQL import

2. **Data Exploration & Analysis**

   * Basic exploration (row counts, distinct values, grouping)
   * Aggregate analysis (average horsepower, price distribution, etc.)
   * Comparative queries (fuel type vs price, top speed comparisons, etc.)

## Tools Used

* **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** → Data cleaning
* **MySQL Workbench** → Data exploration and analysis
